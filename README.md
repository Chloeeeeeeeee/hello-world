Hello WORLD,

 I'm George Estellore. I'm new to this thing called 'github'. I have a degree of Bachelor of Science in Information Technology.
 I love minimalist. I'm not a pro in terms of programming but I have knowledge and idea in it. I'm a goal digger and I strive myself to 
 become a better version of myself, personally and professionaly. I always keep learning.
